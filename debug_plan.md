## Crashing Bugs 

The start point of this code has 2 bugs.
This was the way I solved them! :)

## A) One Piece Per Spot:


## B) Reseting Puzzle Pieces:

1) Assigned an id to each img in the div with class "puzzle-pieces".
2) Reseted drop-zone.
3) Called each piece by their id.
4) For each item in the pzlPieces collection, added a child element to the puzzleBoard element.
